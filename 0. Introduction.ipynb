    "## 1.1. Why Python\n",
    "For many people, the Python programming lanugage has strong appeal. Since it first appeared in 1991, Python has become one of the most important programming languages today. \n",
    "Mostly this is because of the rise of the demand of Data Science.\n",
    "\n",
    "But fundamentally Python has the following things going for it:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Python is \"second best at everything\"\n",
    "- Python is easy to start, but mature enough to grow with you.\n",
    "- Python has a community that is the envy of most open source languages."
